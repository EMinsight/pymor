pyMOR 2024.2 contains contributions by Maximilian Bindhak, Dmitry Kabanov and Art Pelling.
See `here <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/blob/main/AUTHORS.md>`__ for more details.


Main new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Randomized leave-one-out error estimator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In `[#2370] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2370>`_, a leave-one-out error estimator
for the :class:`~pymor.algorithms.rand_la.RandomizedRangeFinder` was implemented.
The leave-one-out error estimator can be activated by setting `error_estimator='loo'`
and estimates the Frobenius norm of the approximation error. Note that while it can be
faster and more accurate in practice, this option does only support Euclidian inner
products and there are no results on its failure probability so far.

Recalculated shifted Cholesky QR algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We implemented a version of the Shifted Cholesky QR algorithm in
`[#2304] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2304>`_, in which the shift is
recalculated in every iteration. The algorithms works reliable even for highly
ill-conditioned matrices.

New approach to time-dependent parameter values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The concept for time-dependent parameter values was improved and made clearer in
`[#2385] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2385>`_. There is now a strict distinction
between constant values and time-dependent values. In particular, code that is not aware
of time-dependent parameter values should not fail silently anymore if such values are
provided.


Backward incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dropped Python 3.8 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We officially dropped support for Python version 3.8 in
`[#2358] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2358>`_. The latest tested version is
now Python 3.9.

Removed ids for vector spaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Identifiers for |VectorSpaces| were removed completely in
`[#2357] <https://github.com/pymor/pymor/pull/2357>`_ and are not supported anymore.
